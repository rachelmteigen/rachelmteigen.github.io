  <p>I have a talent for building up operations for startups, and I like to think of myself as the human swiss army knife.  My background is varied: project management, recruitment, human resources,  sales, accounting, operations, and data analytics. I do my best work where there is little structure but just an overall large and daunting goal. For my last startup, I built and wrote the operational playbook from the ground up, which included HR, payroll management, and managing vendors.   I immediately developed strategic relationships with key stakeholders and vendors, which dramatically reduced our shipping costs and increased clients. Furthermore, I created and built our first accounting/invoicing system, which was in errs for $45,000 in the first month. The word “impossible” does not exist in my vocabulary this has led me to live in Yemen and learn Python.  With a great team, hard work, tenacity and a little bit of luck everything is achievable.</p>
